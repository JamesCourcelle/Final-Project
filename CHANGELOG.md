Changelog

## 3/14/2018:
Code was previously written that was not intiialy put into a repository.
For this reason, the initial push is a larger code base than I would normally push at once.
It is also important to note the lack of testing and any current plan for the project.
My next steps will be to write the appropriate unit tests for the current code.
From there, I will take a TDD approach to development.

# TODO next
Create unit tests and adequately ensure my current code is functioning as intended.
