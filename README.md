# Final-Project
For my capstone at SNHU for my CS degree I will be converting a previous project from C++ to python.
The project takes in two csv files that are sorted and then placed into a binary search tree data structure.
From there, the user can display each entry of data sorted by ID number in ascending order. 
The user is also able to search for one entry with by entering the ID number associated with the entry.

## Dependencies
This project is currently using Python 3.7.0 32-bit.
